## Understanding Django and Stripe API

### Django

Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Here's a brief overview of its core features:

- **Model-View-Template (MVT) Architecture**: Django follows the MVT architectural pattern which helps in organizing the codebase. The model represents the data structure, the view handles the logic, and the template manages the user interface.

- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**: Django's ORM allows developers to interact with the database using Python objects and methods instead of writing raw SQL queries.
- **Admin Interface**: Django provides a built-in admin interface to manage application data and perform administrative tasks. It is customizable and can be tailored to fit specific project needs.

- **Security**: Django includes robust security features out-of-the-box, such as protection against SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and clickjacking.

### Stripe API

Stripe is a powerful and flexible payment processing platform. The Stripe API allows developers to integrate payment processing capabilities into their applications. Here are some key aspects of the Stripe API:

- **Payment Processing**: Stripe enables handling various types of payments, including credit and debit cards, digital wallets, bank transfers, and more. It supports multiple payment methods and currencies, making it ideal for global e-commerce.
- **Secure Transactions**: Stripe ensures secure transactions by adhering to industry standards for encryption and data protection. It is PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliant, providing a high level of security for online payments.

- **Developer-Friendly**: Stripe offers well-documented APIs and SDKs (Software Development Kits) for multiple programming languages and platforms. The API is designed to be intuitive, making it easy for developers to implement payment processing in their applications.

- **Customization**: Stripe provides extensive customization options, allowing developers to tailor the payment experience to their
  Users.
- **Dashboard**: Stripe provides a comprehensive dashboard to monitor and manage payments, subscriptions, customers, and other financial operations. The dashboard offers detailed insights and analytics to help businesses make informed decisions.
